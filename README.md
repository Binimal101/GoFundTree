# GoFundTree

GoFundTree is an Augmented Reality (AR) web application designed for mobile devices. The project was inspired by the need for more green spaces in urban areas, specifically in heavily urbanized cities like Newark, from where our team is based. Our app allows users to visualize how trees could transform their surroundings by placing virtual tree models using AR, snapping photos, and sharing them. In addition, users can donate to raise funds for real-world tree planting projects, turning what they see in AR into reality.

Will be adding more functionality in the coming weeks to support integration with more browsers & provide a better interface for selecting the type of greenery to be visualized for easier access.
